# JavaScript Algorithms to Prepare for Coding Interviews

## Overview
This repository contains essential JavaScript algorithms that will help you prepare for coding interviews. Each algorithm is accompanied by an explanation and example implementation in JavaScript.

## List of Algorithms

1. **Reverse String & Integers:** 
   - Description: Reverse a string or integer.
   - Implementation: [Link to code](reverse_string.js)

2. **Palindrome:** 
   - Description: Check if a string is a palindrome.
   - Implementation: [Link to code](palindrome.js)

3. **Max Char:** 
   - Description: Find the most frequently occurring character in a string.
   - Implementation: [Link to code](max_char.js)

4. **Array Chunking:** 
   - Description: Divide an array into chunks of a specified size.
   - Implementation: [Link to code](array_chunking.js)

5. **Title Case:** 
   - Description: Convert the casing of strings to title case.
   - Implementation: [Link to code](title_case.js)
